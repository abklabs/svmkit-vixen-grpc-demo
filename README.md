# Solana Single Validator SPE with Yellowstone GRPC plugin

This example brings up a private cluster containing a single Solana validator running a Yellowstone
GRPC geyser.

## Running the Example

0. Have `pulumi` installed, logged in to wherever you're storing state, and configured to work with AWS.

- https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_login/
- https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration

1. Run `pulumi install`; this will install all of the required pieces for this example.

```
% pulumi install
```

2. Create and select a Pulumi stack

```
% pulumi stack init dev-node-grpc
```

3. Run `pulumi up`

```
% pulumi up
```

After succesfully deploying, run the following to get your stake account addres which you will need for a later part of this demo:
```bash
% pulumi stack output stake_account_key
```

4. Access the GRPC via Port Forwarding

In the example, the deployed validator is running remotely, so youâ€™ll need to forward the relevant ports to your local machine to test the GRPC geyser.

Forward the ports to your local machine:

```bash
% ./ssh-to-host 0 -L 10000:localhost:10000
```
You can now test the GRPC connection by connecting to `localhost:10000` from your local machine.

5. Run the client demo

In another terminal, run the following:
```bash
% cd client
% npm install 
% STAKE_PK=$(pulumi stack output stake_account_key | jq -r .[] ) npm run client
```
This spins up a client that connects to the geyser and waits for updates to the stake account.

In the previous terminal (from step 4) enter the following:
```bash
% solana deactivate-stake <STAKE_ACCOUNT_FROM_STEP_3>
```
and watch in the other window as the client handles this change

6. (Optional) Tear down the example

```bash
% pulumi down
```
