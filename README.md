# Solana Single Validator SPE with Yellowstone GRPC plugin

This example brings up a private cluster containing a single Solana validator running a Yellowstone
GRPC geyser.

## Running the Example

0. Have `pulumi` installed, logged in to wherever you're storing state, and configured to work with AWS.

- https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_login/
- https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration

1. Run `pulumi install`; this will install all of the required pieces for this example.

```
% pulumi install
```

2. Create and select a Pulumi stack

```
% pulumi stack init dev-node-grpc
```

3. Run `pulumi up`

```
% pulumi up
```

4. Access the GRPC via Port Forwarding

In the example, the deployed validator is running remotely, so youâ€™ll need to forward the relevant ports to your local machine to test the GRPC geyser.

Forward the ports to your local machine:

```
% ./ssh-to-host 0 -L 10000:localhost:10000
```

5. (Optional) Tear down the example

```
% pulumi down
```
